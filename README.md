# Task 1 - Python Web Scraping

- This task tests your understanding of Python language in applying it to a specific well-defined task of web scraping.
- Create a Python script for enabling web scraping.
- Input: Url (medium article)
- Output: File stored in your local machine with the text from the url
- Submission files: .txt and .py file

#### You require the following libraries to accomplish that.
**os** - File storing in the local directory of your machine
**requests** - Used for sending requests with url as input and get html source as response
**beautifulSoup** - Used in parsing html source response https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/

#### Steps to be followed to complete this task
**1.** Import library
**2.** Study the library usage in its documentation
**3.** Fill in the blank provided in the Script (Write your code between Code goes here and Code ends here comments)
**4.** Run the python script with the given url of medium article
**5.** By running the script, a new folder called “scraped_articles” would be created in your local machine.
**6.** Please find the .txt file and upload that as the submission file along with your python file.

# Task 2 - Github
- This task tests your understanding of Github commands and processes in pushing new code into the existing repo.
- Replicate the answer from the previuos Python script for enabling web scraping into a Jupyter Notebook. Push these three files (text file, python script and notebook) into your Github account.
- Input(s): Text (.txt), Python script (.py) and Notebook (.ipynb)
- Output: Github account with these three files pushed, reviewed and merged into the master branch of your repo

#### You require the following to accomplish that.
**python script** - Task 1 answer (.py)
**Text file** - Task 1 text file (.txt)
**Notebook** - Replicated answer in a notebook file (.ipynb)
**Github repo** - Your repo that you have created already

#### Steps to be followed to complete this task
**1.** Open a new jupyter notebook and name it task2.ipynb
**2.** Replicate the answer you’ve got in Task1 into cells inside the newly created notebook
**3.** Choose one of your classmate and add him/her as a collaborator in your Repo's settings
**4.** Create a new branch called "github_task"
**5.** Commit the .py, .ipynb and .txt files
**6.** Push these files into the branch
**7.** Create a Pull Request with a Reviewer you have selected
**8.** Wait for approval from your reviewer
**9.** Merge the branch into the master branch
**10.** Submit the repo link as the submission file
